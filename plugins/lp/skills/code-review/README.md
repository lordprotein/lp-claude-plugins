# LP Code Review

A comprehensive code review skill for AI agents. Performs structured reviews with a senior engineer lens, covering architecture, security, performance, and code quality.

## Features

- **SOLID Principles** - Detect SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP violations
- **Security Scan** - XSS, injection, SSRF, race conditions, auth gaps, secrets leakage
- **Performance** - Big O complexity analysis, memory leak detection, N+1 queries, CPU hotspots, caching issues
- **Error Handling** - Swallowed exceptions, async errors, missing boundaries
- **Boundary Conditions** - Null handling, empty collections, off-by-one, numeric limits
- **Removal Planning** - Identify dead code with safe deletion plans

## Usage

After installation, simply run:

```
/lp:code-review
```

The skill will automatically review your current git changes.

### Targeted review

You can also pass an argument to review specific code instead of git changes:

```
/lp:code-review src/auth/               # review all files in the auth folder
/lp:code-review src/services/payment.ts  # review a specific file
/lp:code-review auth                     # find and review everything related to auth
/lp:code-review PaymentService           # find and review PaymentService code
/lp:code-review логика корзины           # search and review cart logic by keywords
```

The argument is interpreted flexibly — it can be a file path, folder, class/function name, or a description of the feature to review.

## Workflow

0. **Mode Detection** - Targeted review (argument) or git diff (default)
1. **Preflight** - Scope changes via `git diff` (skipped in targeted mode)
2. **SOLID + Architecture** - Check design principles
3. **Removal Candidates** - Find dead/unused code
4. **Security Scan** - Vulnerability detection
5. **Code Quality** - Error handling, boundaries, test coverage gaps, breaking changes
6. **Performance** - Complexity, memory leaks, CPU, I/O, caching
7. **Output** - Findings by category (Security, Architecture, Performance, Quality) with severity badges
8. **Confirmation** - Ask user before implementing fixes

## Severity Levels

| Badge | Level | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 🔴 | Critical | Must block merge |
| 🟠 | High | Should fix before merge |
| 🟡 | Medium | Fix or create follow-up |
| 🟢 | Low | Optional improvement |
